            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p class="col-12">Welcome to Uptown Bikes, your number one source for bicycles.
                We're dedicated to giving you the very best bicycles, with a focus on three characteristics,
                <em>dependability</em>, <em>customer service</em> and <em>uniqueness.</em><br><br>

                Founded in 2020, Uptown Bikes has come a long way from its beginnings in a
                car garage. When the founder first started out,
                his passion for helping other companies be more eco-friendly and cycling drove him to quit his day
                job, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. On
                September, 2020, Uptown Bikes received $100M funding from angel investors and the European Union. We now
                serve companies and organizations all over the world and are thrilled to be a part
                of the eco-friendly wing of the industry. As of July 2020, more than 5 million people go to their job
                daily with their bicycle!<br><br>

                We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or
                comments, please don't hesitate to <a href="./contactus.html">contact us</a>.
